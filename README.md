# timed-java-quiz

## Description 

This project was designed to help familiarize yourself with a typical coding assessment containing multiple-choice questions and 
interactive coding challenges should this potentially come up in a real world scenario. The Java Coding Quiz can teach you the 
basic format for multiple-choice layouts, setting css style attributes in JS, setting a timer, iteration over an array containing questions and answers, 
logging score counts, and how to store/retrieve information via local storage.
